# SuperSimpleShell

A very simple Linux/Unix shell program. Currently supports most basic commands,
but does not support more advanced shell features, such as pipes and shell scripting.

Completed as part of a class assignment for CMSC 421 at the University of Maryland,
Baltimore County. The utils.h, utils.c, and Makefile files were provided by Professor
Lawrence Sebald; all credit for and rights to these files belong to Professor Sebald. T
hey are included in this repository out of necessity for the program to function, and
