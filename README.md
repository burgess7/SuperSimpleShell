# SuperSimpleShell

**Current and future students of CMSC 421 at UMBC may NOT use or consult this work for ANY
purposes related to their CMSC 421 coursework.**

A very simple Linux/Unix shell program. Currently supports most basic commands,
but does not support more advanced shell features, such as pipes and shell scripting.

Completed as part of a class assignment for CMSC 421 at the University of Maryland,
Baltimore County. The utils.h, utils.c, and Makefile files were provided by Professor
Lawrence Sebald; all credit for and rights to these files belong to Professor Sebald. 
They are included in this repository out of necessity for the program to function.

Other than the three files mentioned above, the rest of this project was completed
from scratch by myself.
