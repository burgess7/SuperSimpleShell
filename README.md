# SuperSimpleShell

A very simple Linux/Unix shell program. Currently supports most basic commands,
but does not support more advanced shell features, such as pipes and shell scripting.

Completed as part of a class assignment for CMSC 421 at the University of Maryland,
Baltimore County. utils.h and utils.c files were provided by Professor Lawrence Sebald;
all credit and rights to these files belong to Professor Sebald. They are included in 
this repository out of necessity for the program to function, and no copyright
infringement nor academic misconduct is intended by posting this repository.

All files besides utils.h and utils.c were created from scratch by myself, Evan Burgess.
